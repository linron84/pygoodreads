  <description>&lt;strong&gt;About three things I was absolutely positive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, Edward was a vampire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, there was a part of him—and I didn't know how dominant that part might be—that thirsted for my blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first book of the Twilight Saga, internationally bestselling author Stephenie Meyer introduces Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, a pair of star-crossed lovers whose forbidden relationship ripens against the backdrop of small-town suspicion and a mysterious coven of vampires. This is a love story with bite.</description>

And more so, how did I get hooked in the first place? There's no denying its sweet and innocent charm surrounding the characters no matter how annoying they seemed. The biggest draw for me that held my attention to the very end, was my hope that someday Bella and Edward’s relationship would reach a perfect crest against all insurmountable odds -- self inflicted or not. Your review is illuminating and spot on! Thanks for sharing. <br><br>I can add to your list of manly perfections that indeed, sweep a female off her feet. Perhaps not as eloquent as you, but here it is...<br><br>Women, and especially teenage girls, love the idea of seeing something tender and vulnerable under a "bad" guy's hard exterior. This makes him more appealing, more beautiful, even sexy. We sense his guarded heart and we want to release it, hold it and nurture it. But taming it is not enough. Ultimately, we want it to love us back. Bella understands Edward's goodness and makes him realize it too. Which in turn, makes him love her even more. What woman wouldn't want that kind of power over a man. Not malicious power, but power all the same. How dramatic and utterly ideal is that.<br>]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I told my husband that it would behoove him and all men to read these books to get an understanding of what it is a woman really wants in her man. (Stephanie Meyer got it absolutely right for me! And this is coming from someone who put off starting the Twilight series until 2009 because I was so turned off by the hype, and because I abhor romance novels. ) Anyway, he didn't like that idea, so I just sent him a link to your review instead. Thanks!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I love your comments. They are humorous and started a great conversation at my family and friends night. I am just happy that Mrs. Meyer wrote a book that pre-teens, teens, and parents/adults can actually sit in a room together and discuss with great fervor. You are a very good critic and columnist.]]></body>

What Meyer couldn't do in 450 odd pages you did in two screen scrolls - made me smile and laugh out!<br>As you rightly put it, this is more of a female-wishlist than fantasy fiction, and what made it even better to comprehend was the unmistakable yet completely non-nasty sarcasm there!<br>You made my day!

  <body><![CDATA[This was a hilarious review that I could certainly agree with -from the woman's perspective. <br>As someone who has never understood the "vampire craze" that has seemed to infect everyone and having never read the books, you have sparked a desire in me to read them.<br>Thanks for sharing and being so insightful in a witty and honest way. Would love to read your thoughts on so many other popular books! I'm sure it would provide boundless entertainment and accurate assesments beyond the media hype.<br>And I'll add to the pleas for your male version....put me on the list for a copy!]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[As a woman (not a teenager), I am hesitant to admit that I enjoyed the book, as it pertains to fantasy. Especially after reading the not-so-flattering comments posted here. But isn't fantasty the purpose of books like this? To take one away from the dulldroms of the mundane life lead everyday. To wish for the perfect man, albeit a little cold to the touch. The paleness I can deal with. I mean who wouldn't want a man who sparkles in the sunlight? Besides, men who hold open doors, help you with your coat and leap from treetop to treetop are few and far between these days. <br><br>Having heard all the hype, I finally succomed to the pressure and gave it a once over. Although not a book I will keep on the shelf, I did enjoy the image I created and the model of Edward that seemed to defy your "Men Are From Transylvania" theory. I'd be happy to start my shopping there however, if indeed men like Edward were the product of the creepy Romanian county set high in the Carpathian Mountains. Perhaps it is Transylvania's Roman heritage that would create a man like Edward. Don't get me wrong, he's no chariot driver. But fast, strong and chiseled he is, in my mind anyway. Maybe there should be a carving in marble of him? <br><br>Your review was hilarious and made me pee a little. Thanks for the late night chuckle. I will sleep on it and might one day plan a trip to a mountain village on the other side of the globe. Who knows what I will come back with! A lion, perhaps? Bahhhh. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Ah James, how did I miss this great review of "Twilight"??? And if all men wrote the way you do, perhaps those of us who are of the female persuasion would have less to bitch about! I had read your review of the final book in the series and appreciated it so much that I asked to be on your friend list, but somehow I didn't catch this review until today. <br><br>As you know, like Renee, I too have enjoyed the "Twilight" series, even though I feel a bit shame-faced in admitting it,and I've never been able to put my finger on quite WHAT the attraction has been. <br><br>I think you are "spot-on" with your assessment of the series' charms for women - - and I loved the male-centric version of "Twilight"! <br><br>Thanks for making my day. ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Thanks for your excellent review. I enjoyed the books, though I recognize the fantasy aspect of them. <br><br>But, I also think they are valuable in creating intergenerational discussion about some of life's important themes. Sure, the differences between men and women are there as you have so wonderfully articulated. But i think there are also some strong concepts about what does it mean to be moral? What does it mean to be different? What does it mean to seek to control your (sin) nature in a world in which others don't? Is love more about commitment or feeling? Does love change over time, should it? What about salvation - do our actions in this life matter, and how do you know? <br><br>I agree most of these are questions that appeal to women, as we tend to work out our morality in the context of relationship. But, as a discussion starter between men and women, and even more potent, a discussion starter between moms and girls, mentors and young adults Twilight has a lot to offer.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Although you've already heard this quite a lot: you're review was amazing. It was undeniably truthful and resonated a tone that wasn't mocking (ahaha, I do love to mock Twilight--I'm not going to lie).<br><br>I'm appalled at the positive response Meyer's half-decent writing has garnered, and being fourteen I've seen the affect it's had on young(er), impressionable females. I have friends who broke off relationships with really nice guys "for Edward", and those more drastically, who have chosen to abstain from dating until they find their "Edward". They're crazy over him for the exact reasons you listed; and they're so jaded by his impossible perfection they don't even consider finding the joys or taking the time to fall in love with peoples quirks. Anyway, I find it ludicrous; thank you for posting this! :) ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I agree with Robin. I have emailed this review to people a billion times. Your analysis is just so accurate, and you expose the truth about the book in a way that answers all my questions about why I like the novel even as I recognize that, as literature, it pretty much sucks. Nevertheless, I continue to read it... Honestly, your review is fabulous. Published books or no, you do have a way with words! Good luck with that, by the way! ]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[How can so many people miss the satirical tone of the review... or am I wrong.<br><br>Women need to get a grip and accept men for who they are and stop fantacising about what they could be. Men don't have vaginas therefore they will never measure up to a woman's expectations. When women finally understand this there will probably be fewer divorces.<br><br>Contrary to what post modernism wants us to believe, there are huge differences between the way men and women think.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[I loved your review, mostly because you put into simple language all my conflicting emotions over these books. I have been reading them non-stop for two weeks (even neglecting my beloved Jane Austen :0 ). As an English major and lifelong lover of books, I have been unable to reconcile this obsession I have with this series of books that clearly need lots of editing and reshaping. I am forwarding this review to my husband so that he will understand why I have become so "unlike myself".]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Your review was very insightful. I hate how people say there was too much details and that Stephenie Meyer is anti feminist. All you simply did was explain the appeal it has to women and did it in a very respectful way. Unlike some of the other inmature men who thought it would be funny to bash it.]]></body>

  <body><![CDATA[Very insightful review but most intelligent and well read women do not like this book.. It's mostly marketed for over-sexed tweens and under-sexed middle aged women! <br>The reason Edward and Bella don't have sex until after they are married is because the book is written by a Mormon..]]></body>
