I thought it was too funny not to share:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I read this book because (13 year-old) had been told it was such a GOOD book. She read it and really liked it. So then I read it and the rest of the ones in the series. As a mother I had a couple of \"issues\" with this book. It is very romantic and they talk a lot about being SO in love. I had to explain to her that men do not talk like that. Second of all, he should NOT be spending the night with her - even if nothing happened. Third of all, just because he is trapped in a 17 year old body, he is still 80+ years old. Why would he be so attracted to her? I enjoyed the book, but as a mature 40+ year old, I can see it for what it is - a fun, good read. I worry about all the young teen girls who read this and think this is what and how love is. I hope they have someone to help bring them down to earth. It would be nice if love were really that great and men expressed them selves so freely, and you could always feel that pitter-pat in your heart, but from my years of experience it's just not like that. Sorry to dash your hopes - maybe it's like that for you. Enjoy the book and the others that follow. It was a quick fun read, though.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~***~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found that these books speak to that teenage heart hiding deep within my \"tainted by the real world\" exterior and I get great enjoyment out of going back to that part of me that I miss a great deal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI relate to the main character in the story \"Bella\" she is an awkward teenager who doesn't always see herself as others see her and has a hard time seeing why \"Edward\" the drop dead gorgeous vampire would want anything to do with her. True, the boy I loved in high school wasn't a drop dead gorgeous vampire, but he was beautiful to me and took my silly teenage heart for granted and walked all over it, but that's enough about him for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I go on my views and a few things I would like to address:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~*~*~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“It is very romantic and they talk a lot about being SO in love. I had to explain to her that men do not talk like that.” \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout this book being very romantic and all the talk about being SO in love - well - It hasn't been too long since I was a teenager myself ..... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e As a young teen girl that is \"what and how love is\". Saying \"that's not love\" is one thing, but to a teenager that is IT. I have volumes of poetry and stories that I have written on this exact topic. Go to any teenager and they probably have the same.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a teenager I believe that we feel/felt things more deeply and experienced more in those few short lived years of our life the I think we ever will again. I loved more deeply/lustfully/openly/truly/vibrantly in my 3 years of high school then I have any day since then, and before anyone gets all offended I will clarify that REAL love, ETERNAL love and the SECURITY of love shared with a spouse or family or friends is completely different, but no less true or electric.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, in real life men don't talk like that, but sometimes the men in our heads do. Who hasn't had a conversation with a man in their head and every word that came out of his mouth was sweet and romantic and full of feeling and truth? I'm sure most women have. Just because the men we are with on a daily basis don't talk like that it doesn't mean we don't want them to. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Second of all, he should NOT be spending the night with her - even if nothing happened.” \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ways of LDS youth are not always the ways of the world, and just because the book was written by a former BYU student doesn't mean that the pages need to be dripping with gospel doctrine and perfect morals. That's Jack Weyland's job. She was writing a book for large publication where in a lot of places and to a lot of people this morality is the norm. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 17 I spent the night with a boy - nothing happened, we shared a twin-sized bed at a sleep over where one of the only reasons I went was because it was his sister, at his house. Was it right? probably not. Did anything happen? he kissed me. Did my parents know? they do now. Do I feel guilty about it? no. Am I the only LDS girl who has ever done this? Absolutely not. Does that make a difference? no. Does this make me a bad person? No. Face it. Teenagers do things because we can and because we want to, not because our parents tell us to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Third of all, just because he is trapped in a 17 year old body, he is still 80+ years old. Why would he be so attracted to her?”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, he's a vampire. Yes, he's 80 + years older then her, but is it more appropriate for that said vampire to date a 17 year old or should he bee looking to the older women in the 40 + still looking like a 17 year old? Just because he'll live forever doesn't make him any less needy then the rest of us and perhaps his body and his feelings are stuck in that perpetual 17 year old state. (why am I defending a fictional character?!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"It would be nice if love were really that great and men expressed themselves so freely, and you could always feel that pitter-pat in your heart, but from my years of experience it's just not like that.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually we all grow up. Even though this book gives the illusion of \"what love is\" and that teenage girls will believe it ... Eventually we all grow up. What is the harm in believing that maybe somewhere this kind of love is possible and that the person you choose to spend eternity with will love you deeply and electrically and unconditionally? Shouldn't that be how life is? That's how I love my soul mate, it's not always perfect, but it is deep and true and I hope it stays that way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca

It surprised me when he chuckled under his breath. There was an edge to the sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe doctor's cool fingers probed lightly along my skull. He noticed when I winced.\u003cbr\u003e\"Tender?\" he asked.\u003cbr\u003e\"Not really.\" I'd had worse.\u003cbr\u003eI heard a chuckle, and looked over to see Edward's patronizing smile.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I think I need help,\" I admitted. \u003cbr\u003eHe laughed quietly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI whirled, one hand flying to my throat in surprise.\u003cbr\u003eHe lay, smiling hugely, across my bed, his hands behind his head, his feet dangling off the end, the picture of ease.\u003cbr\u003e\"Oh!\" I breathed, sinking unsteadily to the floor.\u003cbr\u003e\"I'm sorry.\" He pressed his lips together, trying to hide his amusement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You look awful,\" he told me, grinning.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. He constantly monitors your actions, your movements, even conversations with friends. He knows things about you he shouldn't be able to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I followed you to Port Angeles,\" he admitted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe reached the door ahead of me and opened it for me. I paused halfway through the frame.\u003cbr\u003e\"The door was unlocked?\"\u003cbr\u003e\"No, I used the key from under the eave.\"\u003cbr\u003eI stepped inside, flicked on the porch light, and turned to look at him with my eyebrows raised. I was sure I'd never used that key in front of him.\u003cbr\u003e\"I was curious about you.\"\u003cbr\u003e\"You spied on me?\"\u003cbr\u003eHe was unrepentant. \"What else is there to do at night?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I come here almost every night.\"\u003cbr\u003eI whirled, stunned. \"Why?\"\u003cbr\u003e\"You're interesting when you sleep.\" He spoke matter-of-factly. \"You talk.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"It was unquestionably a complication that I couldn't simply read your thoughts to know what your reaction was to me. I wasn't used to having to go to such circuitous measures, listening to your words in Jessica's mind...her mind isn't very original, and it was annoying to have to stoop to that.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"All that next day I eavesdropped on the minds of everyone you spoke to.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Your truck will be here, and the key will be in the ignition – unless you're afraid someone might steal it.\"\u003cbr\u003e\"All right,\" I agreed, pursing my lips. I was pretty sure my key was in the pocket of a pair of jeans I wore Wednesday, under a pile of clothes in the laundry room. Even if he broke into my house, or whatever he was planning, he'd never find it. [He totally finds it. We never learn how.]\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. He's very possessive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHis eyes shifted their focus slightly, looking over my shoulder and narrowing. I glanced behind me to see Mike's back as he walked away.\u003cbr\u003e\"What?\" I demanded.\u003cbr\u003e\"Newton's getting on my nerves.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Do you remember the day that Mike asked you to the dance?\"\u003cbr\u003eI nodded. \"The day you started talking to me again.\"\u003cbr\u003e\"I was surprised by the flare of resentment, almost fury, that I felt.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I knew that if I continued to ignore you as I should, or if I left for a few years, till you were gone, that someday you would say yes to Mike, or someone like him. It made me angry.\" [He's talking about going away because he thinks he may not be able to stop himself from killing her. So, translation: I'd rather kill you than see you with someone else. Lovely.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.\" Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. \"To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned.\" [To a guy who had the nerve to ask Bella out on a date.]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"I'm not mad at Billy,\" he corrected in a clipped voice. \"But his son is irritating me.\" [His son, Jacob, danced for a few minutes with Bella at the Prom.]\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e9. He wants to know absolutely everything about you. Not in bits and pieces as your relationship develops, but right away.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e10. He insults you, denigrates you, and treats you like a child. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Bella, it's not my fault if you are exceptionally unobservant.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Do you want a ride to Seattle?\"\u003cbr\u003e\"With who?\" I asked, mystified.\u003cbr\u003e\"Myself, obviously.\" He enunciated every syllable, as if he were talking to someone mentally handicapped.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis smile was condescending now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You've got a bit of a temper, don't you?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe were near the parking lot now. I veered left, toward my truck. Something caught my jacket, yanking me back.\u003cbr\u003e\"Where do you think you're going?\" he asked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Don't you have a jacket?\" His voice was disapproving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Be careful. The child has no idea.\"\u003cbr\u003eI bridled a little at the word \u003c/em\u003echild.\u003cem\u003e \"Jacob is not that much younger than I am,\" I reminded him.\u003cbr\u003eHe looked at me then, his anger abruptly fading. \"Oh, I know,\" he assured me with a grin.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Don't be difficult, Bella.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e11. And he always has to have his own way. ALWAYS.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Honestly, I'm not hungry,\" I insisted.\u003cbr\u003e\"Humor me.\"\u003cbr\u003eHe walked to the door of the restaurant and held it open with an obstinate expression. Obviously, there would be no further discussion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Drink,\" he ordered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Tell me,\" he finally commanded after persuasion failed.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, wait. Vampires aren't real. This list won't help you check if your boyfriend's a vampire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt'll sure help you figure out if your boyfriend is abusive and/or a stalker, though. And sadly, those \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e exist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI'm not here to trash people who enjoy this book. I wrote this review because I'm worried about the girls who buy merch that says \"I'M JUST A BELLA WAITING FOR MY EDWARD.\" Don't ever say or think that about yourself. Don't be that girl. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe a woman. Be a grownup. Write your own story. Don't depend on a guy to come along and do it for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd for Pete's sake, if a moody, brooding guy says, \"I'm dangerous. You should stay away from me,\" say, \"You're right! Except actually, \u003cem\u003eyou'd\u003c/em\u003e better stay away from \u003cem\u003eme.\u003c/em\u003e Or I'll drop some dynamite on your sparkly little dangler.

James\"\u003eFifty Shades of Grey\u003c/a\u003e)and perhaps nothing to add what all the reviewers have already said.\u003cbr\u003eI’m writing this because it’s been sometime that I’ve written a review and I have nothing else to write about. So, where to begin...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst of all, two things\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwilight isn’t bad! *Please, don’t unfriend me*\u003cbr\u003eAnd Twilight isn’t good either! *Now, we’re even. Eh?* \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor first point:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, Twilight turned out not to be that bad as I was expecting it. After I didn’t enjoyed The Hunger Games, one thing that I learned is to keep my expectations really low to enjoy YA-novels. This wasn’t a hard job after reading umpteen 1-star reviews.\u003cbr\u003eAlso one of the main reasons behind reading it was, I wanted to see how bad, really how bad a book can get.\u003cbr\u003eSo I had my expectations really low, I was thinking it would be book to which giving even 1-star would be like inflating its rating. But once I started reading (keep in mind that I’ve not watched any movie in the series, just few random scenes), I was caught not-so-ready for the good parts of the novel that made me to give it 2-star rating.\u003cbr\u003eTo start with I liked the characterisation of the main characters Bella and Edward, they certainly felt like real human, which is in my view very unusual for a YA-novel. Many people just hate this novel because they think Bella is a loser, well, she certainly can’t be source of any inspiration but it is not necessary that for a novel to be good that its protagonist should be kick-ass or bad-ass or something in the line of ass. \u003cbr\u003eThen Stephenie Meyer very cleverly chooses Forks as the setting of the novel, which assists the further things that she comes up in the novel.\u003cbr\u003eThen she shows her creativity by giving new aspects to age-old existing norms of vampire by telling they sparkle in sunlight, though it’s funny but nevertheless it’s creativity.\u003cbr\u003eAnd yes, the writing, I have heard a lot about Stephenie Meyer’s bad writing but for me it was kind of okay. Initially it was interesting too but then...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut then Shit happened...\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eEverything was fucked up, Bella was fucked up, Edward was fucked up, Stephenie Meyer’s writing was fucked up and the whole story was fucked up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll so good Bella started stumbling, would just fall down every now and then.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e “Are you referring to the fact that you can’t walk across a flat stable without finding something to trip over!”\u003cbr\u003e“Obviously” \u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI think Stephenie Meyer would have read somewhere that every human has some shortcoming and fault in their human aspect, so she came up with this shit, BELLA STUMBLES! For no reason she would just trip over nothing. What image should I have of Bella in my mind, in movie Bella looks like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841i/681097.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"350\" alt=\"description\" class=\"escapedImg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeauty, isn't she!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut after all those stumbling and falling down in every nook and corner of Forks, I think of her as something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841i/681098.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"description\" class=\"escapedImg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay okay okay! I know that was way over the top but definitely something like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1380223841i/681099._SY540_.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" alt=\"description\" class=\"escapedImg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, she even seems to be telling “I was supposed to play Bella until that bitch came and took both movie and Robert Pattison.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo wonder characterisation is great, but not good since she takes 300 pages for this small task. In 90% of the book she talks about nothing but Bella and Edward. Bella talks about every body part visible of Edward: his topaz eyes, his nose, his hair, his teeth, his chest, his breath. She just knows that he is like some greek God and nothing beyond that, and so loves him. OMFG! This is what many people call the best love story ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Edward, umm.... \u003cbr\u003eHe is the most beautiful, a vampire, he sparkles, he is 108 year old so definitely a paedophile and yes a stalker. Stalking may look all cute and loving in an immature story but in reality it is really not cool, who goes sneaking into his girlfriend’s room to watch her sleeping. That’s friggin’ weird and creepy.\u003cbr\u003eOh! And he chuckles too, like Bella who keeps falling for no reason this Edward the 108 years old, keeps chuckling all the time, for no reason. I read a line today that said:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e “Never trust people who smile constantly.They’re either selling something or they are not very bright” \u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor Edward, I don’t know... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd finally the story\u003c/strong\u003e, actually Stephenie Meyer must have writing continuously for 300 pages how Bella and Edward love each other and how handsome Edward is, then suddenly she must have realised something is missing in the whole book: Oh yes! The story. So she came up with this GREAT STORY.

There's also absolutely nothing wrong with the writing! It's not in any way juvenile or badly written. I have no idea what most people are talking about.

If this book encourages the above mentioned girls to read more, great. But for the rest of us, Meyer's novel doesn't have a whole lot to offer. There seemed to be a lot of pointless scenes (the vampire family playing baseball in the woods? Are you \u003cem\u003ekidding\u003c/em\u003e me?),and the ending was annoying. It was as if Stephanie Meyer realized that she would eventually have to end the Edward-Bella Romantic Tension Montage, and so she quickly and improbably introduced an antagonist for an ending that felt hasty and tacked-on.\u003cbr\u003eWhat I'm about to write next will, I know, count as nothing less than pure blasphemy to dedicated Twilight fans, but here it is: I didn't like Edward.\u003cbr\u003eTake a moment to collect yourselves, and I'll explain.\u003cbr\u003eI didn't understand why he liked Bella so much (or for that matter, why every single boy in her high school falls in love with her almost instantly), and sometimes in the scenes between him and Bella, he struck me as very patronizing and controlling. He had a need to constantly remind Bella that he could snap her like a twig if he wanted, and then went on to tell her that he would take care of her, and that he knew what was best for her. There was no balance in Edward and Bella's relationship - he held the power, and he made all the decisions. The scene at the very end, where he basically forces her to attend Prom depsite her objections, was especially unsettling to me. \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"635333048583378668\"

If the world likes a movie, I will hate it. If the world hates a television program, it will quickly become my favorite. I don’t agree with her over all analysis, I mean I love Harry Potter, The Office, and many other popular things. Of course I also thought that The Da Vinci Code wasn’t as good of a book as everyone else thought it was and I am still not sure if Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip should have gone off the air, even if I was about its only viewer. So maybe my roommate was right. Maybe I am prejudice against what most people like. The problem is when I picked up Twlight by Stephenie Meyers I wanted to like it. I had been hearing about it for years, my sister is constantly reading it and I am fielding complaint letters at work that we carry it (usually that is a good sign that the book is good, no really it is) so though I had resisted the popular nature of the book I was secretly pleased when my book club decided to read it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuess what, I hated the book. No really hated it. So E, remember back when we did our Harry Potter review you wondered what would happen if I read and reviewed a book I didn’t like? Well you get to find out now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you who have missed the Twilight mania currently sweeping the nation (my sister boasts she was one of the first Twilighters) it is the story of Bella, a 17 year old girl who relocates to Forks, Washington after her mother remarries. She is miserable there and longs for the sun and warmth of Phoenix. But then she meets fellow 17 year old Edward Cullen. She is drawn to Edward for some reason, though he seems to absolutely despise her. As the weeks go by she gains new friends and settles into a routine in her new town, which includes wondering why Edward hates her so much. Of course he finally begins talking to her, and we find out he is love in with her. There are several events that lead up to the big reveal, but the reader isn’t surprised by this Lizzy/Darcy relationship. Of course there are mysteries surrounding Edward, mysteries that Bella is determined to solve. And guess what she finds out he is a vampire!!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay so yeah that is the story in less than 144 words. Of course there are trials and tribulations that Bella and Edward face after this big revelation. Bella compares them to a modern day ‘Romeo and Juliet’ something that made me gag every time it was alluded too. I must say Meyers got the one dimensional love sick teenager down to a tee. Then there is the brooding, Heathcliff type, Edward. Good looking, dangerous, dark, mysterious, I am not quite sure what he sees in immature Bella, maybe we will find out in the next book. He is one of the few well rounded characters in the book. Though his struggle and flip flopping get old after 200 pages (the book is 500).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is trite. In fact nothing happens until page 378 and then you get about 50-55 pages of great story, interesting, fast past, oh my gosh I can’t stop reading and then it is over and you are back to the boring and the mundane. For the last 60 or so pages. Where is more of the hemming and hawing you had to endure for the first 377 pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew I should have given up when it took me three days to get through the first chapter. When I was a week into reading and hadn’t even made it half way through. When I picked up an old text book and started reading it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I didn’t expect this to be Faulkner, or Austen, or Fitzgerald. I didn’t even expect this to be Rowling, I expected your average book that would be a quick and fun read. I read those all the time. I read any trade mystery I can get my hands on and love it even more if there is a splash of romance, but this makes me shiver. The writing is juvenile, I have read online fanfic writers who are better wordsmith’s than Ms. Meyers. The story non existent, and there are no redeeming qualities in the main character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one thing that saves this book (besides the 55 pages of actual story and decent writing) is the support cast. I really liked Edward’s mom and sister. I wanted to see more of them, learn more about them. But of course they were simple bystanders that I had to wonder about. There were things that were never explained (maybe they are in the sequels, but I don’t think I will ever find out) and so many plot holes I was ready to tear my hair out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo maybe my roommate is right.

And I think this desire needs to be reasonably reflected in the subjective star rating. Now I've seen bookshelves with all four \u003cem\u003eTwilight\u003c/em\u003e books marked “read” and only \u003cem\u003efive stars\u003c/em\u003e between them. Dear Goodreaders, am I in the wrong to believe that this is axiomatically disingenuous? I know there's often some difficulty in weighing one’s subjective response (or lack thereof), particularly when a book has much to be admired or, more relevant in this case, little to be admired. And Goodreads certainly doesn’t make things any easier by failing to address the obvious need for half stars. But giving a book one star and then continuing a series that you ostensibly hate for another 1500 pages? I don't buy it. So anyway the truth is that I \u003cem\u003ekind of\u003c/em\u003e am almost mildly sort of interested in reading the next one. Therefore, this book is already at two stars. If I go forward with \u003cem\u003eHalf Moon: Chess Piece\u003c/em\u003e or whatever book two is called (I’m guessing here based on rushed glances into airport “bookstores”), then I promise I will bump this up to three stars out of a dedication to ratings fairness...and then do whatever is necessary for absolution. I certainly won’t claim that this book deserves two or three stars—something that will become increasingly obvious below—but I did tear through the last 100+ pages (after the baseball thunderstorm game—don’t ask) before immediately watching the movie On Demand, by myself, on a Saturday night. I understand that this confession is grounds for many Goodreads friends to begin hiding their last names and emails \u003cem\u003estat\u003c/em\u003e. So be it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsidering the setting and subject matter of this book, the fact that I frequently found myself engrossed is beyond terrifying (petty high school drama piques my interest? Really? \u003cstrong\u003eFuck.\u003c/strong\u003e) and is mostly responsible for my inability to face reviewing this for so long. But let’s start with the somewhat objective good here. One thing I wasn't necessarily expecting is the disturbingly realistic picture of white middle class banality that makes up the early portion of the book. It's the one thing Meyer seems to pull off well, although I can’t decide on her intent or the degree to which she tried to push this theme. Obviously we’re supposed to see Edward the very white knight rescue Bella the very white damsel from her very, very white suburban high school hell. Or are we? I’m just going to go ahead and give Meyer credit for subtly satirizing dull, white, meaningless existence even though this is a well-traveled road and she’s probably not even traveling it. Plus 1.5 (take that, Goodreads!) stars. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOk, the bad. All of Edward's smirking, mocking, demeaning, chortling, snorting, chuckling, snickering, sniggering, sneering, and condescending will inevitably induce (or your money back) a reverie in which Wesley Snipes uses every weapon invented in the last three millennia to slaughter livid, spiky-toothed Alexander McQueen models with a degree of fury and vengeance that makes the Old Testament look like a Mr. Rodgers episode. Someone needs to call Stephenie Meyer \u003cem\u003estat\u003c/em\u003e and explain to her that audible mirth is called laughing, and that when you try to add variety with snickering, chortling, snorting, chuckling, et al. you sure as hell better be spoofing ludicrous bad guy stereotypes. But these laughing variants are all credited to Edward, who has obviously been studying Neg Theory and Routines (\u003ca href=\"http://www.seductionbase.com/neg-theory.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.seductionbase.com/neg-theory.htm\u003c/a\u003e) since 1921 (yes, he's really old and proof that maturity comes from a degenerating body, not age). Edward doesn’t just chuckle and snicker though. He chuckles and snickers \u003cem\u003eentire sentences\u003c/em\u003e. As in, “blah blah blah blah blah you have no idea how blah blah dangerous I blah am,” Edward snickered. I wish I still had a copy of this book to get a real quote, but I promise there's very little paraphrasing here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is going to make me sound like your mother, but I don't really give a shit because an entire generation of girls (many of whom are young enough to have ZERO experience in dating) worships a book in which the hero not only treats the heroine like an utterly scorn-worthy creature, but also must save her from every single danger and inconvenience in her life, except for the danger of poor self-esteem since he's hell-bent on humiliating her at every opportunity with snarky comments and scathing glances. Now Meyer gives Edward an easy target by making it clear from chapter one that Bella has some sort of cerebellum disorder that leaves her in a constant state of vertigo, tripping, and man-worshiping that places her at enormous risk for rape, car accidents, gym class embarrassments, and probably autodefenestration. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther justification for Edward's assholery emerges when Meyer tells us that this is just the understandable lashing out of someone eternally denied his true biological yearnings. He's grumpy because he can’t tear open Bella's flesh and suck her dry when he's thirsty. Who can't relate to that? To make things worse, neither can he tear open Bella’s dress and yadda yadda yadda, although the lu*t thing seems to be a bigger problem for our clumsy heroine. This gets me back to the man-worship. Even if you haven’t read the book, you’ve probably heard/read what you \u003cem\u003ethought\u003c/em\u003e to be hyperbole on the number of times Bella uses “perfect” to describe Edward’s face, and to a lesser degree his hairless white man-body. Let me be clear: it is almost \u003cem\u003eimpossible\u003c/em\u003e to exaggerate the absurdity of this aspect of the book. In fact, I’ve enlisted a certain Mr. Kowalski to provide an exact tally of these instances for statistical purposes, assuming he has what it takes to see this book to the end (subtle strategy, I know). Of course, “perfect” is a horribly useless description of almost anything and—always ready to give the benefit of the doubt—I will simply assume that Meyer’s thesaurus ended somewhere between “lau-” and “per-”. But props to her for giving each boy and girl reader the chance to imagine their very own version of the perfect, perfectly-Aryan man-face. Or maybe she just wanted to leave Hollywood studios with maximum creative casting possibilities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy motherly objections to the book are, in fact, terribly ironic considering how gleeful so many parents must be that their children are reading books (yay!) in which the hero and heroine revel in self-satisfied smugness over their precious co-virginity (yay!!). Since the anti-s*x messages have been thoroughly explored at this point, I decided to try very hard to take this aspect of the story at face value, which did ultimately enhance my enjoyment. The more I think about it now though, the s*x thing is basically a cheat because it allows Meyer to get the utmost from intimacy while having a ready excuse to eliminate s*x. This keeps things acceptable for the very young while still managing to entice older readers for whom romantic intimacy has been relegated to (doctored) memories. But once you block out the fact that the essential conundrum of the book is an allegory strong enough to make \u003cem\u003eThe Chronicles of Narnia\u003c/em\u003e appear ambiguous, you can see Meyer succeed in adding a new twist to an ancient storyline—that of tragic romantic love. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich leads me into my theory on the popularity of this book. Let me preface this with an apology in the case that I’m the 179th reviewer to point this out. Meyer takes the key elements from two of the most popular romantic stories ever told and packages them into shiny, upper elementary gloriousness. This is like the vampire romance genre equivalent of what Christopher Paolini did by transferring the exact plot of \u003cem\u003eStar Wars\u003c/em\u003e into dragon fantasy (or so I’ve been told). First, we have Edward cast in the role of Mr. Darcy. While reasons are given for Darcy and Edward being dicks to their heroines for much of their respective books, I’d like to point out that this isn't really excusable. It's also pure fantasy. If a guy treats you like shit for a while only to subsequently fall in love with you and start being nice, you better believe that he's going to be treating you like shit again in 10 years. (As a man who’s been married for almost two weeks, I have all sorts of great, reliable advice like this—just send me a private message). Regardless, I suppose there’s nothing more alluring than a story about a rich, beautiful dickhead who you (erm, the heroine) convert into a loving, kind, passionate, and very rich husband. Stephenie took that one to the bank; high fives all around. The second key to success is more generic: instead of Montagues and Capulets, we get Humans and Vampires. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. Obviou$ but effective. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, to preempt the inevitable catcalls, let me state that this review is a shameless attempt to garner votes. I should also note that this statement is itself a shameless attempt to garner votes. And that second statement was an attempt at humor…which was a shameless attempt to garner votes.

If teen (and adult) readers selected books not by their publicity and popularity, they would easily be able to find better examples of the same genre among other books that have to share shelf space with Twilight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethere were so many parts where i wanted to cry, but not because i was so very, very moved:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eafter only a few interactions, edward says things like \"bella, you don't even realize it but you're so much specialler and better and unusualler and different from every human on the planet. i can't solve this incredibly complex rubik's cube that is you.\" this is often the premise of having a hero/heroine/antagonist in a story. you want them to be different, to stand out somehow, to be special. the problem is that at the point in the book where edward starts saying these things, meyer hasn't actually given the reader any evidence at all that this is true of bella. the reader is in her head, so it's not like she can hide anything, and the only special thing about her is that she is the new girl in town, not as used to rain, and very clumsy and disdainful. the fact that meyer actually needs one character to explain to the reader how they should feel about the main character/first person narrator kind of gives it away, doesn't it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eedward also says furiously things like: \"jacob must be punished, O beloved, divinest long-necked white bird. for he saideth that you're pretty. OMG, YOU'RE NOT PRETTY! you're a transcendentally beautiful cygnet, and so far beyond pretty that for him to call you pretty is like spitting on you so i have to go break his bones now. your blood smells good and i glitter, so i can't let anyone insult you so horrendously.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ebella: \"Don't hurt him, i'm sure he didn't mean it.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eedward: \"All right, but only because you say so, i'll let him live. but if he ever dares call you pretty again, i'll make him sorry.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eat this point, i wondered why meyer was showing any restraint at all, and why she wasn't having edward earnestly say things like \"Did it hurt, when you fell from heaven?\" with a straight face. and mean it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei can't even begin to understand what emotional mechanism is making this character and this writing seem attractive to the primarily heterosexual, young adult female readership. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei think part of the guilty pleasure many young women (myself included) have gotten from several books comes from the appeal of the fictional characters, and sometimes from the romantic appeal of the male characters. it's embarrassing, but it's very often true. that said, the improbably-named \"bella swan\" herself as a character is nothing to look at, personality-wise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emr. darcy's appeal: subdued and aloof, but passionate despite himself, and all of this Austen managed to convey with skill and restraint. howl, owner of the moving castle, is vain and cowardly and flamboyant, but a good writer makes all that somehow appealing! anne's gilbert is natural, genuine, the schoolboy chum who grows up fairly quickly to be a very respectable man. twelfth night's duke orsino is...not very inspiring, but viola-turned-dashing-cesario more than makes up for it (not technically a male, but whatever). across genres and historical periods, writers have managed to sketch out nuanced, compelling characters, from the rough, deeply, fallibly human to the fantastically, impossibly unattainable superhuman. but edward?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eedward glitters in the sun and says terrible, terrible lines that not even fictional vampires living in washington state should be allowed to utter. bella screams in terror while riding piggyback on her motor-velociraptor-cycle of a boyfriend, rolls her eyes at everyone in her town who's not a vampire, and angrily trips herself a lot. \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"8075445973990980153\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));;

Would Bella being bitten, transformed not signify a loss of innocence better than simply sleeping in Edward's arms?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother problem I had was that there only seemed to be a plot in the opening stage and the final one hundred pages. It was almost as if the author took the middle 200 pages to indulge in her own creations and fantasies without any real development.\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"6498898498147217162\"

Twilight was a book that I got deeply involved with. It was not a casual read that was easy to put down and move onto everyday life. It was a book that I carried around with me and tried to read every chance I could. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe characters are moving and intense, their relationships with each other intimate and touching. I felt Edward's anguish that he can't let go of Bella, although he know he endangers her. I walked in Bella's shoes, feeling her fascination and intense love for Edward. Every touch, word, look between them was deep with emotion and that emotion went straight to my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can honestly say that this is one of the best romances I've ever read. Everything is there that a romance needs. The intensity, the emotion, the joy, the edge of despair of knowing that one is in too deep. And the fulfillment of knowing that your intense love is very much returned. It's what I read romance for. This book is proof that a romance doesn't have to have sex in it to be romantic and intense, or even erotic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRomance aside, the other elements also make this book involving. I was fascinated with Bella and what made her tick. Her interactions with her parents and her friends. Her outlook on life. Her courage at facing a horrible situation out of love for another person. Even everyday things in her life were interesting to me. I would love to know why she's so clumsy. I identified with her in that sense, because I'm pretty clumsy myself. The Cullens are intriguing and I can't wait to learn more about them. I am also looking forward to learning more about their mortal (or should I say immortal enemies) the werewolves. Jacob was cute and sweet and I'd like to see more of him, although I am definitely on Team Edward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike Bella, I fell deeply in love with Edward. He is one of the most magnetic characters ever written, in my humble opinion. I know now that my reading life will consist of Before Edward Cullen and After Edward Cullen. Yes I am a grown woman obsessed with a young adult book, but I like it that way. Those people who despise Twilight because it's a sensation, I challenge you to read the book. If you truly don't like it, then to each their own. But you definitely should give this book a chance. It's worth the time and energy, and the tug on your emotions. \u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"18101371254275001685\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\"\u003e...more\u003c/a\u003e\n\n          \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\"\u003e\n        \n\n\u003ctr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review42220525\"\u003e\n  \u003ctd colspan=\"2\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"updateActionLinks\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link42220525\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=42220525\u0026amp;resource_type=Review\u0026amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F41865.Twilight\"\u003eflag\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u003cspan class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_42220525'\u003e\u003ca id=\"like_count_review_42220525\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/42220525?resource_type=Review\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"likesCount\"\u003e49 likes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026middot;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true\u0026amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F41865\"\u003eLike\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026middot;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"/review/show/42220525?book_show_action=false\u0026amp;from_review_page=2\"\u003esee review\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cdiv id='comments_for_review_42220525' style='display: none;'\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='brown_comment'\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/42220525/comments?reverse=true\"\u003eView all 54 comments\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class=\"loadingAnimation\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"loadingError\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv class=\"clear\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"elementListBrownSeparator\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n  \u003cdiv class=\"friendReviews elementListBrown\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"section\"\u003e\n      \n\n\u003cdiv id=\"review_31373968\" class=\"review\" itemprop=\"reviews\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Review\"\u003e\n  \u003clink itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/31373968\" /\u003e\n  \u003ca title=\"J\" class=\"left imgcol\" href=\"/user/show/731690-j\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"J\" src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/users/1288001880p2/731690.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n  \u003cdiv class=\"left bodycol\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"reviewHeader uitext stacked\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"reviewDate createdAt right\" itemprop=\"publishDate\" href=\"/review/show/31373968?book_show_action=false\"\u003eJul 04, 2009\u003c/a\u003e\n\n      \u003ca title=\"J\" class=\"user\" href=\"/user/show/731690-j\"\u003eJ\u003c/a\u003e\n\n        rated it\n        \u003cspan class=\" staticStars\"\u003e\u003cspan title=\"liked it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"\u003eliked it\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan title=\"liked it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan title=\"liked it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p10\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan title=\"liked it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan title=\"liked it\" size=\"15x15\" class=\"staticStar p0\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\n          \u003cspan class=\"greyText\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026middot;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\n          \u003ca class=\"lightGreyText\" title=\"Paperback 9780316058988\" href=\"/book/show/12024.Twilight\"\u003ereview of another edition\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n          \u003cdiv\u003e\n    \u003cspan class=\"greyText\"\u003eRecommended to J by: \u003c/span\u003e\n      Everyone\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n        \u003cdiv class=\"reviewText stacked\"\u003e\n              \u003cspan id=\"reviewTextContainer31373968\" class=\"readable\" style=\"\"\u003e\n            \n\u003cspan id=\"freeTextContainer14806631957804539571\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAFORE-\u003c/strong\u003e Fine.

It was not like flowers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted him to bite me. Instead he pulled his head up and looked at me curiously. No question came, but I knew he was trying to understand. Trying to see what had brought me to this place. He looked like a cat with his head slightly cocked, as though listening for the words I couldn’t dare to utter. He was beautiful. Dark eyes aglitter, cunning written plainly on his face. Then the cat became a tiger. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e“Get up.” The dream memory broke off and I opened my eyes. The tiger was alive and pacing. “Get up. NOW.” I scrambled to the other side of the wide bed, finally afraid. Two thoughts clicked into place simultaneously: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is what he’d warned me of. \u003cbr\u003eHe’d been watching me sleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there was no hope for me. No escape. I was alone with this beautiful man and this ravenous beast and the danger was of my own design. He’d tried to tell me but, headstrong and foolish, I didn’t believe. And now, when I believed it to the very core of my being, there was no escape. Not that I’d have wanted one anyway.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am such a girl.\u003cbr\u003eYeah. So \u003cem\u003eTwilight.\u003c/em\u003e I’m going to say something here that a few of you may hate me for. This book is not well written. It’s just not. Meyer’s a storyteller but this is not great literature. The typos I grumbled about? I wasn’t complaining so much about the typos themselves – okay, I kind of was - but what really bothered me was the type of typos. It’s clear someone has actually done some editing, but to improve the writing rather than to add a dropped period or correct a misspelling. It didn’t help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet I enjoyed the book. I am such a girl. This is, I am convinced, where Meyer has struck the mother lode. Edward is handsome. Beautiful even. A marble statue of masculine beauty. I hesitate to say hot because the fact is he’s not. He’s cold to the touch, which makes him all the more attractive because he’s a challenge. Untouchable, so obviously all I can think of is touching him. Did I mention he’s handsome? And he likes me. Me! He spends pages and pages and pages fighting down his attraction to me but I’m so sweet smelling, so delicious, so special, he just can’t. I’m his own brand of heroin. More dreaminess: Edward’s beauteous \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e smart. Brains are sexy. Can I get an ‘Amen’? But so is brawn and Edward’s as agile and athletically gifted as he is beautiful. Did I already say he’s beautiful? Sorry. It’s just that he’s \u003cem\u003esooo\u003c/em\u003e beautiful. And rich. And he likes me. Me! And he’s bad. But he’s good. He’s fighting his bad side because he’s so good and he likes me. Me! I must really be special.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd there it is. Special. We girls like to be made to feel special. Like we’re the only one. The only one whose mind he can’t read and the only one whose mind he wants to read. The only girl he could spend all day talking to and still want to spend tomorrow with. The only girl he’s ever kissed. I’m so extraordinarily special that he’s fighting his very nature for me. Never forget Edward is a vampire. He’s dangerous. C’mon, you know you like it.

Edward gets too much attention. Bella’s a better character. She’s smart, isolative, insecure, forthright, reserved, confusing, well, everything a teenage girl can be. I imagine every woman can relate to Bella’s attempts to navigate a, ahem, challenging relationship. I like Bella. She’d be a good kid to have around the neighborhood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eC\u003c/strong\u003eullen family. I suppose you can’t develop every character equally, and maybe you get more on each of them in the sequels, but the Cullens (outside of Edward) were as cardboard as they come, esp. Esme, who seems interesting but hardly speaks. And what’s the deal with Emmett? And Carlisle? I want to know. And what about that one who hates Bella? I can’t even remember her name, she’s so unimportant to the story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eD\u003c/strong\u003eoubt. These two fall in love awfully quickly, and the doubt/fear about some pretty heady issues gets resolved in literally a couple days. Now, one could argue that’s how teenage love develops, but I don’t know I agree.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eE\u003c/strong\u003edward. You know what I find fascinating about Edward? I think, if you pay attention to Edward, you might learn something about what women/girls like in some guys. Edward is not a predictable doormat wuss. He gets angry, jealous, and petulant (you think he’d grow out of that, but he says this is a new experience). Bella doesn’t always get her way with him. But he’s gorgeous (as the author says, oh, about 11,000 times) and loyal. Gentlemen, pay attention to Edward. He may lead the way. He’s like a goth Zac Ephron.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eF\u003c/strong\u003eorks. I could live in Forks. I like the natural, familiar rhythms of the town, how everyone seems to know each other without any typical “book small town” hokeyness.

Bella and Edward’s relationship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eH\u003c/strong\u003eigh school. The author does an admirable job of walking the characters through Forks’ secondary school days. No one broke into dance. The kids were pretty good, for the most part, but engaged in regular petty intrigue. Realistic, I would say.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003emmortal. I can understand Bella’s desire for immortality. But how much do we really know about Bella? I mean, there’s more there, of course, because of what Edward can’t do (get your mind out of the gutter, pervs, not that) to her. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJ\u003c/strong\u003eacob is another interesting character that seems as if he’ll be important in a later book. He’s more Bella that Edward, slightly dorky and charming, more human (um, literally and metaphorically) and approachable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eK\u003c/strong\u003eiss. Did they ever actually kiss, full-on? It’s hard to tell. I think they did, but the author gets a little flowery when Bella and Edward touch. I don’t get the whole “abstinence” controversy. I don’t think this book is a covert “don’t have sex” tract.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eL\u003c/strong\u003eoyalty, a major theme in the book. Should Bella and Edward be loyal to each other?

Edward’s got, ahem, an age issue with Bella. He’s older than her. Does that make a difference? How come he still acts like kind of a brat?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eP\u003c/strong\u003erom.

How did the Cullens stay hidden in Phoenix? I thought Phoenix was sunny all the time. And how come the schools never protested when the Cullens skipped school? Was it the mind control crap? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eR\u003c/strong\u003eules. Throw all the traditional vampire rules into the dumpster. Holy water fails to make an appearance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003eex. Yes, Bella asks if they can do it. You know she wants to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003easte. Apparently Bella is all kinds of tasty to the vampires.

This is where the author shines…she makes Bella sound like a unique, fascinating individual while also leaving just about any reader with elements to which she could relate. I give Meyer credit for her characterizations, and it’s not just Bella, but Charlie, the high school kids, etc. She only drops the ball with the vampires (outside of Edward, of course).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eW\u003c/strong\u003eashington.

I know I said this before, but it’s a major problem in the book. You think Edward would, you know, learn something over the years, but he still sounds seventeen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eZ\u003c/strong\u003eealous readers. Do I want to read the next one? Maybe. I liked the movie, even though Kim says the film version “sucks ass”. I’m curious about this whole Jacob thing and where that might lead. And I still don’t know what in the hell is going on with Bella and her evident, if passive, powers. So, like I said, maybe. \u003cem\u003eTwilight\u003c/em\u003e isn’t as smart or well-researched as \u003cem\u003eOutlander\u003c/em\u003e, the last book of this nature I read, but I think it’s more fun and definitely an easier read. I think it’s fair to ask anti-Twilight factions to get over themselves…the book may be more popcorn than arthouse, but it’s decent. I can understand the book’s appeal at the same time I feel like I still have a lot to learn about what women like about guys like Edward. And if I’m thinking that much after reading a book about vampires and teenage girls, well, the time was well spent. If \u003cem\u003eTwilight\u003c/em\u003e falls into your lap, it’s worth a couple hours of your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"4718476506869025316\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\"\u003e...more\u003c/a\u003e\n\n          \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n      \u003cdiv class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\"\u003e\n        \n\n\u003ctr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review53141696\"\u003e\n  \u003ctd colspan=\"2\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"updateActionLinks\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link53141696\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=53141696\u0026amp;resource_type=Review\u0026amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F41865.Twilight\"\u003eflag\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u003cspan class='likeItContainer' id='like_container_review_53141696'\u003e\u003ca id=\"like_count_review_53141696\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/53141696?resource_type=Review\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"likesCount\"\u003e47 likes\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026middot;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true\u0026amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Freviews%2F41865\"\u003eLike\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026middot;\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"/review/show/53141696?book_show_action=false\u0026amp;from_review_page=2\"\u003esee review\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n    \u003cdiv id='comments_for_review_53141696' style='display: none;'\u003e\n\u003cdiv class='brown_comment'\u003e\n\u003cspan class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/53141696/comments?reverse=true\"\u003eView all 30 comments\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class=\"loadingAnimation\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"loadingError\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"comment_20834434\" class=\"brown_comment\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"xhr_comment_photo\"\u003e\n    \t\u003ca alt=\"Akhilesh Gupta\" href=\"/user/show/4275794-akhilesh-gupta\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d.gr-assets.com/users/1284200351p1/4275794.jpg\" alt=\"4275794\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"xhr_comment_body\"\u003e\n    \u003ca style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/4275794-akhilesh-gupta\"\u003eAkhilesh Gupta\u003c/a\u003e\n\n      \n\u003cspan id=\"freeTextContainer13821735249759541997\"\u003ewonderful literature.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u003cbr\u003eakhilesh\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.aonergy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.aonergy.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\n    \u003cbr/\u003e\n\n    \u003cspan class=\"xhrCommentFooter greyText\"\u003e\n      Sep 11, 2010 11:22AM\n    \u003c/span\u003e\n\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"clear\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"comment_115000016\" class=\"brown_comment\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"xhr_comment_photo\"\u003e\n    \t\u003ca alt=\"Mia\" href=\"/user/show/38768227-mia\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/f_25x33-d79c46f9428d2aea1444d67c091766a6.png\" alt=\"F 25x33\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"xhr_comment_body\"\u003e\n    \u003ca style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/38768227-mia\"\u003eMia\u003c/a\u003e\n\n      \n\u003cspan id=\"freeTextContainer4166230572318258709\"\u003eHow do you think Bella is a good character????

I was late into the Twilight universe and was very hesistant to read them but i wanted to see what all he fuss was about. I wasn't at all a reader back then so obviously this was the first one in this genre I read. And it took me a while untill i was sold on this book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut when I was it was magical! I adored everything about the world Stehenie Meyer created in Forks. First, Bella and Edward's epic love story \u003cstrong\u003eCOMPLETELY SPELLBOUND \u003c/strong\u003e me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI found the fact that he was a 100+ year old vampire, trapped inside a 17 year old body, completely miserable as a vampire, to finally find his true love with Bella, so romantic. Some people found it creepy but.... come on people, this is fiction. Don't take things so seriously. I loved the fact that he spent endless nights with her, just watching her sleep. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain. Come on people. Don't take it so seriously. I loved and adored literally every scene in Twilight. Everything about it compelled me. But most of all. I love Edward Cullen! He is and always will be in ty topp-3. \u003cem\u003e Alice. \u003c/em\u003eI want you as my best friend. And \u003cem\u003eEmmett.\u003c/em\u003e I want you as my big brother. Every character was so unique and fachinating to me and I wouldn't mind reading a novel about either one. (Not Jacob.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eRosalie, Jasper, Carlile and Esme\u003c/em\u003e, I think\u003cem\u003e Twillight\u003c/em\u003e is the only book I have read and started again when I was done, so much do I love it.

But Twilight is a romance meant for teenage girls longing for a romantic escape, realism would only detract from the magic of Forks and the Cullens, if you want to enjoy this book then you must embrace that inner fangirl and let go of your outer author. I only wish that Mrs. Meyer had put more effort into at least making the characters more real. Questions such as why the Cullens returned to Forks arise or why they are attending high school again (according to an FAQ it is to stay current with new discoveries but surely such a small town is not ideal for knowledge), I like to pretend that the Cullens returned to Forks for Alice and Jasper's sake so they could be at the beginning of the vampires' enemies as well as learn to be human in a small town before moving on to bigger things- alas, such reasoning is not used and we must accept this reality without explanation, which even my inner fangirl cannot accept.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe romance- some love it, some complain how unrealistic and stupid it is. Well, it is Bella's first love, despite all the male attention she didn't care. Edward has read the minds of everyone around him for 90 years, immediately labeling someone and (most likely) not giving them a chance beyond politeness, then comes along a girl whose mind he can't read and whose blood drives him to the edge of insanity; when he learns more about Bella he sees a, mature girl who shares similar hobbies, and enjoys old fashioned things (like himself). Alas, what I have pointed out (actually based on someone else's review) is not remarked upon in the book; we are to accept that they love each other and that is all- no questions, their love transcends time and they shall die for the other and blah, blah, blah. If only Meyer had Bella and Edward explain their attraction to each other, then this book would be more liked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main character is either called smart or stupid. Bella does display positive traits: unlike the sequels she is selfless enough to get her friends together and move to Forks so her mother can be happy with her boyfriend, Bella is also intelligent enough to be placed in an advanced program, she displays a sarcastic wit which eventually turns into decent humor rather than complaining, she reads the classics like Austen, listens to Debussy and other music quite often, and most importantly, is very observant- she notices the Cullens vampire speed speaking to each other, how they don't eat their food, how Edward's eye color changes, their abnormal camping season, and how beautifully alike they all are. \u003cbr\u003eOn the bad side: Bella is not wise enough to think that as a danger prone, clumsy, bad luck magnet that she may be in danger at night, alone, in an unfamiliar city. Her intelligence is arguable when she is in Edward's presence since she either is too consumed by first love to think clearly or she is perhaps, so stupid and selfish she doesn't care (which becomes apparent in the sequels). A neutral trait is Bella's clumsiness- a common Moe Moe trait- which is actually rather cute given that it is random and not serious (unlike the sequels) but her clumsiness is questionable in it's realism- though thankfully, her clumsiness didn't set in motion events (unlike the sequels which only happened because of an ACCIDENT than her clumsiness). Her issue with blood is my biggest gripe, I know real people are hemophobes (fear of blood) but it just seems out of place with Bella, of all her traits, this one feels the most tacked on, existing only for irony.\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest flaw is not even of her character but of her appearance. If you read Meyer's FAQ you will see just how similar Bella is to Stephenie only her appearance reminds me of a cute anime girl- the clumsy Moe Moe. Bella's name is even worse: Isabella Marie Swan- Beautiful Swan- gee, that's subtle. I cannot fathom how Eric, Mike, Tyler, and Jacob all came to pursue Bella- Eric is desperate, Mike is popular so he doesn't make sense, Tyler only wants to make up nearly killing Bella, and Jacob falls in love with Bella with nothing more than the knowledge that this girl used to hang out with his older sisters. Then of course is Lauren- the most popular girl in school- who becomes jealous of Bella for the rest of high school for having so much attention and not wanting it.\u003cbr\u003eBella reminds me of Fujioka Haruhi from Ouran High School Host Club, only Haruhi is cool and special, I can understand why four guys and a girl love her and why a mean girl is envious. Only Bella chooses to fight because she knows she will trip if she tries to run while Haruhi will choose to fight to protect girls from jerks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEdward's appeal comes largely from the fact that no man (or woman) can be THAT romantically perfect. My fangirl coos at Edward's suave, flirtatious, and mysterious nature (also because he wears a turtleneck) while my author longs for a more solid character. All of Edward's charming characteristics stem from his experience as a vampire rather than the son of a wealthy lawyer in Chicago who dreamed of fighting in the war- but either 90 years of mind reading and some of killing bad people leads to a questionable conclusion, I just don't feel that Edward's past is part of the vampire Bella meets. Also, his angst- laughably dumb. Sorry Ed, but I just don't care, perhaps it is Edward's nature to try and help others but his past escapades of murder and heroics are forgotten after they are mention and are not recalled in the sequels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe writing was simple and had a nice magical ring to it, it brought a real sense of the misty, green atmosphere behind Bella's house and the sunny yellow meadow of Edward's.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big problem I have with Twilight is how we must exit Bella's head to analyze characters. Bella's self esteem seems fine in the beginning given how she doesn't care for the male attention nor cares for Lauren's envy but as she falls in love with Edward he is seen through her \"first love and with the perfect guy\" eyes and Edward as a person is lost to Bella considering him perfect. Luckily, we only encounter a few of her self-depreciating comments- only when she is caught by surprise by Edward's vampiric beauty (and for the first time). But I do not enjoy having to analyze these characters through the eyes of a girl who can see nothing but absolute perfection. Bella is supposed to be observant and yet cannot pick out characteristics like how much Edward questions her since he can't read her mind and especially not what someone would be like after 90 years of immediately labeling someone by reading their thoughts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an author and reader, I roll my eyes at Meyer's biggest mistake- whereas my fangirl was excited and happy with the random encounter of James' coven, I still know how desperate Meyer must have been for an exciting conclusion and so tossed this in. Albeit, fangirls will enjoy the cat-and-mouse game at the end (as well as the character development of Alice and most definitely Jasper) but critics will scoff at the sudden appearance to conclude what just was a mystery and romance driven plot where the only danger was Edward himself. The worst part of the encounter is how this completely random wind sets in motion the hunt, not even Bella's clumsiness (which may have improved the chase), but a wind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeyer had plenty of opportunities to be the new Anne Rice (with actual literary credit rather than a strong fan following) and yet she fails to create strong supporting characters, secondary characters, world, vampire mythology, and overall a strong story. Her vampires have NO WEAKNESSES, rather than die in sunlight they sparkle, they even have super, special, awesome powers- some which effect Bella and some that don't, which goes unexplained for two books. While I am not a romance fan and have no interest in romance myself, I was still enchanted with Twilight. Alas dear reader, the magic shrivels up and dies in New Moon and Eclipse; trust me, stop here- maybe read New Moon since a lot happens plot and relationship wise, but DO NOT read Eclipse for even though important stuff does happen it is handled so poorly I can scarcely acknowledge it.\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"920181799522003256\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));;

No build up, no rationalization, no sense, just a statement of illogical fact.\u003cbr\u003e7) The hero's Deep Dark Secret is revealed and much angsting on his part ensues.\u003cbr\u003e8) Out of nowhere the heroine's life is threatened and she makes an incredibly stupid decision that nearly kills her.\u003cbr\u003e9) Rescue at the last minute and declarations of twu lurv all around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBella's character itself gets more and more annoying as the book goes on. To the point where you want to slap her and yell at her to stop making the female half of the species look bad. I've seen jellyfish with more spine than she exhibits through most of the book. She lets Edward dictate to her and push her around and never does more than sulk and glare. She never makes any real attempt at enforcing her own opinions/desires. The one time she actually shows some initiative, it's to do something so deeply stupid that you wish the two-dimensional bad guy had just killed her and taken her out of the breeding pool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd goodness gracious, has this woman no common sense? I can give no credence to her claim of having grown up in a big city, not when she goes wandering brainlessly on her own down empty streets in an unfamiliar city. No woman who grows up in even a small city would do such a thing. We know better. Bella acts more like she grew up in the suburbs or the country, where they're still under the delusion that crime can't touch them there. She'd be far more believable as a character if that was the background she'd been given. But coming from Phoenix? I don't think so. It just makes her look like, \"All new: Victim Barbie! Push a button and she screams for her man to rescue her!\"\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt should also be noted that this is a looooong book. Not long as in \"many pages\", but long as in \"many pages without anything happening\". I mean, \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"Lord of the Flies\" are both under 200 pages, so is it unreasonable to expect a book that goes past 200 pages to actually, I dunno, do something? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn't have the heart or the time to pick up the next two books, but Mayreen did. So I had Mayreen tell me what happens in the next two books (1200+ pages total). It took her about 10 minutes to summarize the story. And I am confident the 10 minute summary was just as thrilling and engaging as the actual act of reading the 1200 pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it another way, they are making a movie of this book. Usually, when you hear they are making a movie of a book, you wonder \"What will they take out?\". For the first time in my life, I actually wondered \"How are they going to squeeze 80 minutes of story out of this book?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***Apologies to Katherine, Mayreen and the other women in my life who enjoyed this book. I may not understand what this book does for you, but I am not making a judgment towards what may have happened to both of your historically excellent tastes in books.

After she enrolls in the local high school, she finds herself fascinated with the Cullen family, all of them beautiful and mysterious. As she grows closer to the youngest, Edward Cullen, she discovers their secret (they're vampires), and falls madly in love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, that done, let's get on with the main review. . . \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConfession: I only bought this book to make fun of it. I'd read a lot of hilarious parodies, as well as a few painful excerpts, and decided it would be amusing enough to keep me interested. To be fair to Meyer, it wasn't quite as awful as I'd heard. My guilty pleasure has always been wangsty supernatural romances, after all. That said, it still has a long list of faults and parts of it were absolutely laughable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo begin with, until Bella explicitly stated her age, I thought she was 15. She's shallow, mean (her casual, often condescending criticisms of her classmates and the small town make her seem like a total brat), and generally just feels incredibly young. I don't think Meyer really remembers what it's like to 17; that's the only explanation I have for this flaw. Although I fully admit to being shallow when I was that age, I wasn't quite as shallow or dim as Bella and so my overall first impression was how immature the so-called heroine is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe's also stupid. Really, really stupid. There's a section of the book where Edward, once Bella knows his true vampire nature, takes her far away from the town to a secluded forest, and basically tells her that he chose this place in case he loses control and murders her. He even warns her that she might never return home, and insinuates that his family is preparing to clean up after him. Bella's response? Oh, she doesn't care! She KNOWS he'd never hurt her! I mean, she's only known this weird boy for a few weeks/months (and for most of that time he avoided her), and he's only a vampire fighting against his base nature and living on a knife edge, so obviously she's, like, totally safe! I suppose we, the reader, are supposed to think that this is already Twu Wub even though barely any time has passed, and that Bella is just, like, SO brave, but she just reads as a total moron. I was also really uncomfortable with how abusive Edward sounds during these scenes where he warns her that he might just murder her where she stands. He MIGHT kill her but only because she just smells so scrumptious! It's totally her fault! It's just far too reminiscent of 'I only hit you because I love you, baby'.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs if that isn't bad enough, we're told that (aside from her delicious scent) Edward is drawn to Bella because she's the only person whose mind he cannot read (yes, he reads minds as well as being super fast, strong, and immortal), and because she 'responds so differently' to everyone else. She does? When? As far as I could see, she acts like a typical shallow American teenager up until she starts telling him that it's okay if he kills her, because she knows he loves her oh so much! So basically Edward loves her because she's a victim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of Edward, he's not without flaws either. Although Meyer paints him as a typical angsty vampire; fighting against his thirst for human blood so that he can love again, he's often boring and expressionless, and his constant drama was absolutely sickening. By the end of the book, I thought I'd throw up if I had to hear, yet again, how torn he is as he looks into Bella's eyes. Not to mention how he's just SO beautiful and perfect and angelic. Hell, he's so angelic that he freakin' sparkles in direct sunlight.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHE SPARKLES, PEOPLE. Enough said.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe romance, once you get passed all the angst and purple prose over Edward's incredible beauty, is only okay. Bella and Edward can never have sex, apparently, and can barely even kiss, so there are lots of scenes where Edward teases Bella with his light touches whilst her heart stops. No, really; at one point Meyer actually writes that Bella's heart stops so noticeably at Edward's touch that the EKG machine she's hooked up to picks it up, which is actually a sign of a major cardiac condition. Oh, he also makes her faint at least once. How realistic! Either his touch is really magical, or Bella has a heart problem and will die by age 30 from massive cardiac arrest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen there's about one third of the book left, Meyer seems to realise that she'll never get published if something doesn't actually happen, so she throws in a villain and has Bella being hunted by another vampire, one who does not abstain like the wonderful, all-American baseball playing Cullens. Suddenly, Edward's family, who has only met Bella a handful of times, races to save her from this evil man, and even goes on to tell her they love her, even though they hardly know her. D'aww! She's just so speshul. This is, however, my favourite part of the book because the pace actually picks up for the first time, and eventually Bella has the shit kicked out of her. YAH! I was cheering the baddie on but, boo, Edward rushes in to save her, and in her haze of pain she believes him to be an angel because he's JUST SO BEAUTIFUL. Meyer just wants to drive that home, as if we didn't even know from the previous 300+ pages of her going on about this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book ends with Edward taking Bella to prom. Yes, really. And, suddenly, Bella knows she wants to be a vampire, because it's true love and it will last forever! It's not as if we ALL thought our first love would last forever back when we were kids/teenagers, but Bella KNOWS this because Edward is just so special and beautiful and hawt! She gives absolutely no thought to how this will change her life. In fact, she's so needy that she panics when Edward mentions leaving her to protect her from further attacks by rogue vampires, and is so disgustingly upset by the mere insinuation that I think she borders on the deranged. However, considering Edward's confession to stalking her earlier in the novel (he watches her sleep and follows her everywhere, just like a 'normal' boyfriend!), I shouldn't be surprised. Edward, however, is not willing to inflict upon Bella the PAIN and SUFFERING that is his undead life. And so the book ends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I dislike this book, I do understand why some people are so nuts for it. Meyer is unabashedly over the top with her depiction of Bella and Edward's love, and it has everything that every other vampire book has ever covered; angst, mortality vs immortality, bad vampires vs good, beautiful characters, the heroine being supposedly 'special', etc. Over all, though, it cannot hold a candle to previous books of this genre and is just a shoddy rehashing of a very old story. And when I say 'shoddy', I mean it. The prose is clumsy and stilted, and there were a number of what I hope were editing errors, because otherwise Meyer has the worst grammar I've ever seen printed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig thumbs down from me. But fun if you're willing to laugh at such drivel!\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"12826789380122594570\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return

It’s fun in a book, but when you see it in real life, walk the other direction. In my experience, it is possible for creepy stalkers to come around almost anywhere, and the internet is no exception. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don’t want to get lecturey on you, but I think that, especially for people who are the typical targets of stalkers (all you Bellas out there), but really for everyone, it is important to be aware and smart and even suspicious. Don’t give your address to people you don’t know. And don’t think that a compliment is always what it seems. Sometimes compliments are manipulation. If someone makes you uncomfortable or seems suspicious, don’t be afraid to tell them that. Don’t feel pressured to keep yourself in an uncomfortable situation or to talk to people who skeeze you out. You don’t have to be afraid, just remove yourself from the situation. If a friend tells you to watch out for someone, give that advice a chance. I know it’s obvious to say, but I like being reminded every once in a while that you can’t control other people’s actions, but you can control your own.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an example, I’ll tell you a story of one time when I wasn’t smart and didn’t remove myself from a situation. This is a pretty specific situation, and it takes place in Ukraine, but I really think things like it could happen anywhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, my friend, Vanessa, lived in the middle of the country, and I was going to visit her. We met in Kyiv to take the bus back to her city. The bus we got on was old and rickety, and the only seat was right in the front. We were exhausted and Vanessa fell asleep against the window. The bus driver kept looking at us in the rear-view mirror, but I didn’t think anything of it because we were American and got stared at all the time. He must have been going about thirty miles an hour the entire way there, because I think we got in about two hours after we were supposed to. Vanessa told the driver, in Ukrainian, where to drop us off, but he drove right past the stop down to the regular station. We got out at the station and Vanessa was pissed. It was really late, and it would have been easy for them to let us off at her stop. She had just woken up, too. We had both been sleeping off and on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe got out of the bus to get our luggage, and as we were grumbling and trying to find our bags, the driver’s assistant came up to us and explained that they were actually going to let everyone off and drive us BACK to her stop. Oh! We slapped our foreheads. That makes so much more sense. We got back into the bus. (NEVER GET BACK INTO AN EMPTY BUS.) Duh. We were really tired, so that’s some excuse, but not much. Anyway, the driver’s assistant got behind the wheel, and took off in the opposite direction of the town. So, there we are, driving out in the middle of the country (but really the middle of nowhere because there aren’t even houses or lights or anything) with these two old, creepy Ukrainian guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVanessa was freaking out a little bit, and started gathering weapons around her. She had her keys out and some kind of antenna from the dashboard. I don’t remember what else, but that is exactly what you should do if you find yourself in a situation like that. Self-defense 101. The driver, now freed from his driving responsibilities, sat across from me and asked us the Ukrainian for “do you girls like to party?” We quickly answered “no.” He told us that he had a stash of vodka stored in the back of the bus for just such an occasion. He slid his hand over onto my leg. Vanessa immediately slapped it off. You could see the gears in our brains turning. What if we were murdered, there in the Ukrainian countryside, and just left out to rot? What if we escaped, but spent days wandering in circles in the empty fields and eventually died of thirst? Could we jump from a moving bus? Why did we get back on the fucking bus?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, after about ten or fifteen minutes, they pulled up to a gas station – in the middle of friggin’ nowhere, mind you – got gas, and headed back to town. We were fine. We were shaken, and it wasn’t a safe situation, but we were fine. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I’m telling you is this: it’s not your fault if you are the victim of unwanted attention, but there are a lot of things you can do to be smart and safe. Take a self-defense class. Be honest with other people. Listen to your instincts. Block people on the internet if they are making you uncomfortable. Don’t harass people yourself, but if you’re uncomfortable, be smart. Learn from your mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTwilight\u003c/em\u003e is fun. I’m the first to admit it. Fictional Edward is a boyfriend you could buy at Claire’s™. How much does that rock? But in real life Edward is just an old, bossy man with a thirst for blood. That’s not romantic. It’s gross. While awesome, fictional Edward got into Bella’s home through her window, gross, real-life Edwards get into our homes through our computers. (Not literally, although, oooo sci-fi fan-fic waiting to happen?) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt recently came to my attention that a member of goodreads \u003ca href=\"http://emigree.livejournal.com/52781.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewas accused on another website\u003c/a\u003e of using Goodreads(.com) and other places on the internets to harass people - basically he was accused of being a real-life Edward. (I expressly claim the content of that link, though I apologize for its graphic nature. Goodreads(.com) does not claim the content of that link. : this should in no way constitute legal advice to anyone, including Goodreads(.com) or affiliated agencies, but according to §§10, 12, and 14 of my and the accused member's \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/about/terms\"\u003econtract with Goodreads(.com)\u003c/a\u003e, as well as U.S. federal law, \u003ca href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode47/usc_sec_47_00000230----000-.html#230.c_1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e47 U.S.C. sec. 230(c)(1)\u003c/a\u003e, and U.K. law, \u003ca href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/31/section/1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDefamation Act of 1996 §1(3)\u003c/a\u003e, Goodreads(.com) is only a content provider, not a publisher of my statements, and has no liability for what I say on here.  Although Goodreads(.com) may not be convinced that any users of its service are creepy, I am persuaded. We are separate. Please don’t blame it for what I say. I have talked to both parties involved in the incident. Below are the accused’s responses to me. The girl who originally posted the accusations has asked that we not contact her, as all of the harassment she has received from questions about that post has been just about as awful as the original harassment. I hope you will respect those wishes. I would be glad to answer any questions I can about this either in the thread below or in a private message. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might not think that the accusations are true, and that is entirely valid. I did the investigation I needed to do in order to confirm for myself that the accused member of Goodreads is creepy, you can do what you need, or ignore the situation entirely, as you like. I understand the importance in a trial of presuming someone innocent until proven guilty, but I do not believe that I need to wait to have an opinion about someone until that person has gone through a trial. I can have an opinion based on whatever standard of evidence I like, and the testimony of a witness, combined with my own experience, and countered by nothing, is enough evidence to persuade me. Also, I am willing to err on the side of caution where the potential for harm is either exposing Bellas to stalking and harassment, or exposing an innocent man to loss of business. Both are horrible, but the former is more horrible to me. Again, everyone should balance that for themselves. Honestly, beyond blocking him myself, I'm not very interested in this particular person, as I don't think he's at all unique. He serves as a symbol in this review, yes, but a symbol of something much larger and more ubiquitous. If someone STARTS harassing the accused member because of the things I wrote here or for whatever reason, I will think that harassment is as stupid as any other harassment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community manager of Goodreads(.com) has informed me that the appropriate way to deal with a potential predator on Goodreads is to inform the community manager of where the offensive posts exist, and he will delete them. That seems to me like just about the worst way possible to deal with situations like this. Not only does it cover up for the offender by erasing evidence, it also makes it difficult to warn people in the future of patterns. I think the stupidest (bless their ‘lil hearts) way to deal with stalking is to pretend you can stop it by erasing it. I have already blocked the accused member because I don’t want him to access my friends through my profile, but I think censoring his account or his comments is a ludicrous way of “dealing” with a situation. Also, I frankly think that crazy people have the right to read books and talk about them, too. Just because I don’t want to be friends with the accused member, doesn’t mean other people, who are not in danger of being targeted by him, shouldn’t. Plus, deleting his account or comments doesn’t accomplish anything, as he can make a new profile, or write new comments. The point is that we should all be careful (especially the Bellas). Again, trust your instincts and learn from your mistakes. If you have bad instincts, trust your friends. Do the opposite of what Bella does because Edward, in real life, is the opposite of what Edward is in fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI’m a big fan of the Take Back the Night movement, but I don’t think the night is the only thing that shouldn’t be dominated by fear. So this is your call to take back the internet. When goodreads originally took down this review and the others like it, I had invited people to copy my review and write about their own experiences with real-life Edwards. I invite you to do that again if you would like. You are definitely responsible for whatever you copy or change from this review, but you are welcome to it. The world is there for all of us to enjoy, for men and women. Parents shouldn’t be afraid to let their kids use the internet. We are real people on here and should treat each other as such. Don’t let people gain power through fear. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e______________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePOSTS from me to the accused Goodreads(.com) member\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emessage 10: Sep 26, 2010 09:14am\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople around here seem to be very concerned, and with good reason, about this: \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://morbidprose.livejournal.com/24399\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://morbidprose.livejournal.com/24399\u003c/a\u003e...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have a response to these accusations?

However, because you have not responded, I will be more clear.

I read the book on a plane ride to Colorado during spring break, and by the plane ride back I was reading the third book in the serious. I have turned into a huge fan of this series. I’m not sure though I could see myself teaching the book though because of the whole romance portion of the book I think most guys may not like the book as much. This book though I would love to teach, but I don’t see that happening I see this book as more being on an English required summer reading list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSubjects, Themes, and Big Ideas:\u003cbr\u003eLove, unconditional love, soul mates, growing up, being a new kid at school, making decisions that benefit those you love, being strong, doing what’s right.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharacters:\u003cbr\u003eIsabella Swan – Referred to as Bella. She is the main character of this book and the story is told from her point of view. She is living with her Dad in Forks, Washington which is a small town that is very rainy and isn’t really excited about it until she meets Edward (the vampire) and falls in love with him.\u003cbr\u003eRené – Is Isabella’s carefree mom. She isn’t in the book that much because she is moving around with her new husband who is trying to find a job.\u003cbr\u003eCharlie – Isabella’s Dad who she goes to live with so she is able to stay in the same school while her mom and her step-dad are moving around for him to find a sports job.\u003cbr\u003eEdward Cullen – Is the beautiful vampire that Isabella falls in love with and he falls in love with her. His talent is being able to read people’s minds but for some reason he cannot read Bella’s mind. Everyone in his family is unique for vampires because they do not eat humans because they feel that it is wrong instead they kill animals.\u003cbr\u003eEsme Cullen – (vampire) She is appears to be in her late 20s and is married to Carlisle and they tell everyone in town that they have adopted Edward, Emmet, and Alice and that they are foster parents to Jasper and Roselie Hale. She is very companionate\u003cbr\u003eCarlisle Cullen – (vampire) He is married to Esme and is the adopted father to Edward, Emmet, and Alice Cullen and the foster parents to Jasper and Roselie Hale. He is a doctor at a local hospital.\u003cbr\u003eEmmet Cullen – (vampire) Edward’s brother who is the strongest out of the family. He has a relationship with Roselie Hale.\u003cbr\u003eAlice Cullen – (vampire) She is the smallest in the family and can predict what’s happening in the immediate future and is almost always right. She has a relationship with Jasper Hale.\u003cbr\u003eJasper Hale – (vampire) He is the newest addition to the family and to being a vampire. He has a relationship with Alice Cullen.\u003cbr\u003eRoselie Hale – (vampire) She is sort of a bitch and ignores Bella. She is seen as the most beautiful of the family. She has a relationship with Emmet Cullen\u003cbr\u003eJames – He is an evil vampire who loves tracking and decides that he wants to take Bella’s life and will not stop until he is either dead (which he believes he is to strong to die) or Bella is his. He loves the game he makes out of tracking Bella and the obstacles the Cullens and Hales put of to try to protect Bella.\u003cbr\u003eVictoria – Is James’s Mate for life she has bright red hair and she tries to help James get to Bella.\u003cbr\u003eLaruent – He happens to be traveling with Victoria and James but decides to go to another covenant for protection when he finds out that the Cullens and the Hales are going to do everything possible to protect Bella even if that means killing James.\u003cbr\u003eJacob Black – Is a Native American boy that is two years younger than Bella but they bond over the fact that Jacob tells her at the beach stories which he believes to be myths about vampires and werewolves.\u003cbr\u003eBilly Black – Jacob’s father and friends with Bella’s dad Charlie. He is in a wheelchair. He believes in these vampire “myths” and tries to keep/talk Bella out of hanging around Edward and his family. \u003cbr\u003eJessica – The first person that Bella meets at her new high school she is very chatty and has a crush on Mike. \u003cbr\u003eLauren – a snobby girl who isn’t really friendly like everyone else to Bella.\u003cbr\u003eAngela – she is quiet at first but Bella soon realizes she prefers this and likes her as a friend.\u003cbr\u003eMike – He has a crush on Bella since the first day of school and Bella finds this annoying but is still nice to him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlot summary:\u003cbr\u003e\tIsabella (Bella) Swan moves to live with her dad, Charlie in Forks, Washington; so that she is able to go to the same for at least a year until her newly wed Mom’s husband finds a stable sports job. She doesn’t like going there at first because it is always rainy and never sunny. She hates how on the first day of school everyone pays so much attention to her because, the new girl. Everyone goes out of their way to be friendly to her except Edward Cullen and his 2 adopted sibling and 2 foster siblings. They just completely ignore her and she thinks that Edward may even hate her. She sees them eating in the cafeteria and thinks that him and his siblings are the most beautiful people she has ever seen. It bothers her how much she thinks Edward hates her. Later though she finds out that there may be more to him than she thinks. One icy day a car almost hits Bella, but instead of it killing her some how Edward shows up and shields her from the car and he is left unscratched and has saved her life. After a while though Bella figures out that Edward is not only beautiful but he is also a Vampire. This though does not seem to phase Bella and she now find herself head over heals in love with him. She finds out though that Edward didn’t hate her at all, but the opposite he was also in love with her, but thought it would be best to stay away from her. Because, not only does he love her he is drawn to her blood unlike anyone else’s blood and has to keep himself from killing her. \u003cbr\u003e\tAs the novel progresses you find out that Edward protecting Bella from himself is not the biggest threat to her life. Another vampire group, James and Victoria has spotted Bella, and James is a vampire who loves tracking humans. When James sees how defensive Edward is over Bella he sees catching and killing Bella to be one of his greatest tracking challenges ever. This turns the whole Cullen family upside down when they try to protect Bella from James. They risk their livelihood not only for Bella, but they know if Bella dies Edward will end up killing himself too, because he is so in love with her he doesn’t think a life with out her is worth living. In the end James meets up with Bella alone but the Cullen family saves her just in time. They found out that Bella has been bitten though by James and Edward finds himself put to the biggest test of all. He must suck Bella’s blood to get rid of the poison, but not get to carried away in which he kills her. He though successfully removes the vampire venom without killing her. Bella though has received many injuries from James and has to be hospitalized as result towards the end of the book.\u003cbr\u003e\tEdward and Bella’s relationship is one of the strongest ones I have ever read about. Edward realizes he is placing Bella in danger by being with her, but he loves her too much to leave her. Bella loves Edward so much that it does not even faze her that he is a vampire and could kill her any minute. Edward still wants Bella to experience human life though so he tries to participate in all human traditions making it appropriate that the end of the novel ends with Edward taking Bella to the Prom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStrengths (including reviews and awards):\u003cbr\u003eNew York Times Bestseller!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDrawbacks or other cautions:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeaching ideas:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore: Do a Project on Vampires and Vampire Myths\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring: Write a Journal Entry: If you were Bella what would you do?

This book, I think, is just absolutely wonderful. I've never found a book I can read over and over and never be bored with. Twilight is endlessly entertaining. It looks like one of those teenage girl romance books, but it is so much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\tTwilight is about an intense attraction between a teenage human girl, Bella, who falls in love with unintentionally seductive teenage vampire boy, who's name is Edward. Both are drawn to each other in more ways than one. The relationship is indescribably dangerous for the both of them but the two can't help but fall in love. Their love for each other goes beyond undying. It is something that makes anyone entirely wistful. They are faced with many conflicts and amazingly overcome each one. This author's idea of vampires and what makes them vulnerable and what they are capable of is very interesting and rather believable. The character development is out of this world. Bella is someone anyone can easily relate to, and you can understand why it is that she falls hopelessly in love with this vampire. And the first thing that draws me to Edward is that he must constantly exercise self control. He must not feed his hunger and he must deny himself pleasures. Really, it's an amazing book. Read it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t This is the first of 5 books. Book 2 is \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49041.New_Moon__The_Twilight_Saga__Book_2_\" title=\"New Moon (The Twilight Saga, Book 2) by Stephenie Meyer\"\u003eNew Moon\u003c/a\u003e\" available now. Book 3 \"Eclipse\" should be published Aug/Sep 2007. Book 4 \"\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1162543.Breaking_Dawn__The_Twilight_Saga__Book_4_\" title=\"Breaking Dawn (The Twilight Saga, Book 4) by Stephenie Meyer\"\u003eBreaking Dawn\u003c/a\u003e\" should be published late 2008. Book 5 \"Midnight Sun\" has no estimated date. It is a retelling of book 1 from Edward's point of view. Book 1 is done from Bella's point of view. The author has the 1st chapter of book 5 on her website. It's fascinating and makes me desperate to get the book when it finally comes out. For those of you who can't get enough of this story, there are two stories written by a fan on the fanfiction website. On that site, search under Pen Name: twieveluv and you should see two stories titled \"the moonlight\" and \"like us\". I enjoyed these as a temporary fix while waiting for Stephenie Meyer's future books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n  \u003ca data-text-id=\"5658668972991865460\" href=\"#\"

But then, why is it that now whenever anyone fawns over Edward Cullen and tells me how romantic Twilight is, I shudder? I mean I was part of the Twilight-obsessed club. Maybe it was that I wasn't a reader back then, maybe I was just a total sucker for romance, or maybe it was that I was a fourteen-year-old daydreaming teen? Either way, I \u003cem\u003eworshipped\u003c/em\u003e this book and its sequels, and I couldn't wait till the last book came out—Breaking Dawn. But now I wish I hadn't. The whole time I was reading Breaking Dawn, I was internally fighting the urge to throw the book across the room, or better yet, burn it—so I couldn't ever see it again. I felt like I was betraying Twilight and told myself that I was being irrational, and then I searched on Goodreads to see what other people thought of the book. I was really surprised when I saw it had made to the \"worst books of all time\" list. I was soooooo…proud? Because then I knew that I was right; that Breaking Dawn was just a pitiful excuse for a book. And the reviewers? Oh don't even get me started. I just loved reading their 1 star reviews. It's like they were reading my mind! Because I liked their reviews so much, I decided to check out what they thought about Twilight. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe results left my jaw hanging open.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI couldn't believe people hated Twilight! I thought that was blasphemous. But then I started reading further and it was like a light bulb had gone off in my head. Seriously. So I read the book for the umpteenth time. And I mean \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e read. I took in every little detail of the book. And by the end, I found myself hating it with a fiery passion (not be melodramatic or anything). And I wanted to slap a fan girl whenever I came across one—which happened a lot. Now let me tell you why I hated this book: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBella. I \u003cem\u003edespise\u003c/em\u003e this girl. She's incredibly boring, when she's not gushing over how hot Edward was, or how much she loved him and couldn't live without him, she was whining. And really, talking about Edward's beauty in every single page—paragraph—is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e cool. It's disgusting. You don’t have to describe the character every two pages, we know all about Edward’s ‘perfectly toned chest’ the fourth time you mention it. Edward is HOT. We get it. I think I would have enjoyed the book a little more if it wasn't written through Bella's idiotic mind. Not to mention she's incredibly needy and has no life outside of Edward Cullen. That's not how a main character should be. A main character should be smart, witty, and most of all, strong. This girl is shallow, stupid, dim-witted and weak. The situations she gets herself into are just mind boggling. I didn't believe anyone could be that stupid. Here is a little proof of how brainless she really is (and I quote):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-What did she do when she found out Edward was a vampire? \"It doesn't matter to me what you are.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-What did she do when she found out Edward had watched her sleep and practically stalked her before they even knew each other? \"I was flattered.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat should pretty much explain Bella's character. Oh, and she's also a Mary Sue, Bella Swan = beautiful swan, really? That's just horribly cheesy. It doesn't take a genius to find that out. See? Even her name is perfect. I really don't buy all the bullshit she says about being ordinary. If she's so \"plain,\" why do so many guys fall for her within the first 2 chapters? And clumsiness is not a fault, especially when Edward is always there to catch her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book was just full of purple prose. Ugh. I \u003cem\u003ehate\u003c/em\u003e purple prose. This is an example: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"He lay perfectly still in the grass, his shirt open over his sculpted, incandescent chest, his scintillating arms bare. His glistening, pale lavender lids were shut, though of course he didn't sleep. A perfect statue, carved in some unknown stone, smooth like marble, glittering like crystal.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat was just unnecessary. I could've written that whole paragraph in one single sentence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and what the hell was it with Bella and \"holly crow?!\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe characters are all flat and predictable. And apparently it takes Bella \u003cem\u003eone week\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eONE FREAKING WEEK\u003c/em\u003e to be \"unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.\" But how exactly did they fall in love? Oh yeah, Bella smelled like freesia and Edward was hotter than any male model she'd ever seen. How very romantic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd has anyone noticed that Meyer basically wrote down her fantasies? Think about it; brown eyes, brown hair, widow's peak, full lips. The only difference is that Bella is small, which might be Meyer's wishful thinking?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow let's come to Edward. God, someone stake his whiny ass before he gives all vampires a bad name; he's a disgrace. He's also stalker. Watching Bella sleep is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e romantic. It's creepy. And he's supposed to be the mature one. Way, \u003cem\u003eway\u003c/em\u003e more mature. 100 years more mature. He's always acting so calm and cool and wise, and I used to really like that about him, but a 100 year old vampire falling in love with a brainless 17 year old is such a turn-off. I mean, \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e? Couldn't Meyer make the main character a little more intelligent and mature, at least? Because 100 years of age difference certainly equals a pedophile. Not to mention he's extremely possessive and border-line abusive. Edward also has multiple personality disorder. One minute he's smiling, the next he's \"growling.\" Who the hell \u003cem\u003egrowls\u003c/em\u003e? And did I mention that he's perfect? His face, his body, \u003cem\u003eeven his smell and handwriting is perfect\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379752336i/140708.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"199\" alt=\"twilight\" class=\"escapedImg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeyer must be really into this whole pedophilia business, first Edward and Bella and then **spoiler followed with a yuck** Jacob and Renesme.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of the most important questions Meyer never once answered:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Why were the Cullens in high school? Seriously, if they're as hot and rich as Bella claims they are, why would they enroll in high school when they could be doing better things? Why wouldn't they just go and live in **spoiler** Isle Esme (their island—yeah, they're \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e rich) if being around humans is so hard for them? Obviously, Meyer couldn't think of a better place for Bella and Edward to meet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thought this was supposed to be a VAMPIRE book. Where the hell are the fangs? We don't need a bunch of high school pussies that play baseball and \u003cem\u003esparkle\u003c/em\u003e in the sun and can't get killed by stakes. That is \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e how a vampire should be. They are apparently indestructible, and if they're so indestructible, why hide their identities from humans if they can't get killed by them?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Why couldn't Edward read Bella's mind? Part of why I was so enthusiastic about reading Breaking Dawn was that I thought that Stephenie Meyer would \u003cem\u003efinally\u003c/em\u003e explain to us why Bella's mind was immune to Edward's powers, but \u003cem\u003enoooo\u003c/em\u003e …that wasn't important enough. What \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e important was Bella and Edward getting it on day after day after day. Again, \u003cem\u003ehow romantic\u003c/em\u003e. Why could some vampires work their abilities on her, and some couldn't? Bella's mind seems like some deux-ex-machine. Seriously. Edward couldn't read her mind, Alice could see her future, Jasper could alter her emotions, Aro couldn't read her mind, Jane couldn't mind-torture her. Why was she immune to all the bad ones, and not the good ones? And why was it never explained? I just can't get over that, for some reason. I've eased my anger a bit by telling myself that the only reason Edward couldn't read Bella's mind was because she didn't have one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Why wouldn't Edward leave Bella alone? He was like, actually running after her and then saying \"we shouldn't be friends.\" Well it's kind of hard when he's constantly stalking her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd worst of all…the ending.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTHEY. GO. TO. F***ING. PROM.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePROM!\u003c/em\u003e Of all things…\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe could've thought of something a little smarter than that. I mean a vampire wanted Bella dead and after Edward rescuing her from him, \u003cem\u003ethey go to prom\u003c/em\u003e. I just…I don't know what to do with this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only reason the books became so popular is because Bella has no life \u003cem\u003eor\u003c/em\u003e personality, and any loser can put themselves in her shoes. Well, I'm nothing like Bella. She has no goals and no future, her life revolves around Edward. Obsessive much?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow let's come to the idea of the book in general. Twilight is sexist. Stephenie Meyer makes the guy tough and strong whereas the girl is weak and fragile and always needing the guy to come and save her. That's pretty much a huge step backward for women everywhere, who have fought for equality. Do any guys even like Twilight? Poor, poor guys. Their girlfriends are probably waiting by their bedroom windows for Edward to come watch them sleep. Now this is the main message Meyer gives her readers: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGirl: “I can’t live without you. I'll leave my whole family to be with you. If you leave me, I will kill myself. You're hot, I love you.” \u003cbr\u003eBoy: “you smell good. I love you.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, and just a tip, Meyer: if the first 200 pages of your book rely on the mystery of a character’s identity, don’t slap “First, Edward was a vampire” on the back cover. AND complaining about how crappy Forks is is really not cool, you could've just made up a fictional town for Bella to whine about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis book was not worth the paper on which it was printed. You may think Edward Cullen is smart and fast, but Lestat A.K.A. badass-vampire-of-all-time could totally take him. Or even Damon Salvatore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhew. I'm so glad I finished this review. Now I'll finally go and read about a main character that actually \u003cem\u003edoes\u003c/em\u003e something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379752336r/140709.jpg?145218085231811\" width=\"400\" height=\"330\" alt=\"twilight\" class=\"escapedImg hostedImg\" data-src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1379752336r/140709.jpg\" style=\";display:none;\" data-error=\"[image error]\" onerror=\"$j(this).loadHostedImage();\" onload=\"$j(this).loadHostedImage();\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/assets/loading-trans.gif\" class=\"escapedImg loadingImg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow.
